// I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

// P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.


//      MINE!!!

function adder() {
    let arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5];
    let arr2 = [6,7,8,9,10];
    let answer = 0
    for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
     answer += arr[i]
    }
    return answer
}

console.log(adder())
